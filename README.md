## LowRpc

LowRpc is a very toy-like implementation of a RPC framework which builds on Netty, and it mainly serves as my personal practice for network and concurrent programming. 

### Usage

```java
// TODO
```



### Something left for improvement

- [ ] Support for service registry and service discovery.
- [ ] Support for both async and sync calls.
- [ ] Improve the performance.
- [ ] More sophisticated error handling.
- [ ] Add test cases.
